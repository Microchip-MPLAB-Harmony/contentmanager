Open Source Components means any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including any license that, as a condition of distribution, requires Microchip to provide Licensee with certain notices and/or information related to such Open Source Components, or requires that the distributor make the software available in source code format. Microchip will use commercially reasonable efforts to identify such Open Source Components in a text file or “About Box” or in a file or files referenced thereby (and will include any associated license agreement, notices, and other related information therein), or the Open Source Components will contain or be accompanied by its own license agreement. To the extent required by the licenses covering Open Source Components, the terms of such licenses will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement, and Microchip hereby represents and warrants that the licenses granted to such Open Source Components will be no less broad than the license granted in Section 1(b).

(a) Licensee will ensure Third Party compliance with the terms of this Agreement. (b) Licensee will not: (i) engage in unauthorized use, modification, disclosure or distribution of Software or Documentation, or its derivatives; (ii) use all or any portion of the Software, Documentation, or its derivatives except in conjunction with Microchip Products; or (iii) reverse engineer (by disassembly, decompilation or otherwise) Software or any portion thereof; or (iv) copy or reproduce all or any portion of Software, except as specifically allowed by this Agreement or expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding the foregoing limitations. (c) Licensee must include Microchip’s copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices in all copies of the Software, Documentation, and its derivatives. Licensee may not remove or alter any Microchip copyright or other proprietary rights notice posted in any portion of the Software or Documentation. (d) Licensee will defend, indemnify and hold Microchip and its subsidiaries harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees), liabilities, and losses, including without limitation product liability claims, directly or indirectly arising from or related to: (i) the use, modification, disclosure or distribution of the Software, Documentation or any intellectual property rights related thereto; (ii) the use, sale, and distribution of Licensee Products or Third Party Products, and (iii) breach of this Agreement. THE FOREGOING STATES THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY OF THE PARTIES FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT. | Confidentiality. (a) Licensee agrees that the Software (including but not limited to the Source Code, Object Code and library files) and its derivatives, Documentation and underlying inventions, algorithms, know-how and ideas relating to the Software and the Documentation are proprietary information belonging to Microchip and its licensors (“Proprietary Information”). Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Proprietary Information and shall similarly bind its employees and Third Party(ies) in writing. Proprietary Information shall not include information that: (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement and through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) the receiving party was legally in possession of prior to receiving it; (iii) the receiving party can demonstrate was developed by it independently and without use of or reference to the disclosing party’s Proprietary Information; or (iv) the receiving party receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure. If Licensee is required to disclose Proprietary Information by law, court order, or government agency, such disclosure shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement provided that Licensee gives Microchip prompt notice of such requirement in order to allow Microchip to object or limit such disclosure, Licensee cooperates with Microchip to protect Proprietary Information, and Licensee complies with any protective order in place and discloses only the information required by process of law. (b) Licensee agrees that the provisions of this Agreement regarding unauthorized use and nondisclosure of the Software, Documentation and related Proprietary Rights are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Microchip and its licensors and that monetary damages alone cannot adequately compensate Microchip or its licensors if such provisions are violated. Licensee, therefore, agrees that if Microchip alleges that Licensee or Third Party has breached or violated such provision then Microchip will have the right to petition for injunctive relief, without the requirement for the posting of a bond, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity. | Ownership of Proprietary Rights. (a) Microchip and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software and Documentation (“Proprietary Rights”) including, but not limited to: (i) patent, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights in the Software, Documentation, and underlying technology; (ii) the Software as implemented in any device or system, all hardware and software implementations of the Software technology (expressly excluding Licensee and Third Party code developed and used in conformance with this Agreement solely to interface with the Software and Licensee Products and/or Third Party Products); and (iii) all modifications and derivative works thereof (by whomever produced). Further, modifications and derivative works shall be considered works made for hire with ownership vesting in Microchip on creation. To the extent such modifications and derivatives do not qualify as a “work for hire,” Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers, assigns and conveys the exclusive copyright thereof to Microchip, free and clear of any and all liens, claims or other encumbrances, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Licensee and Third Party use of such modifications and derivatives is limited to the license rights described in Section 1 above. (b) Licensee shall have no right to sell, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the Software, Documentation or any related intellectual property rights except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. | Termination of Agreement. Without prejudice to any other rights, this Agreement terminates immediately, without notice by Microchip, upon a failure by License or Third Party to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Further, Microchip may also terminate this Agreement upon reasonable belief that Licensee or Third Party have failed to comply with this Agreement. Upon termination, Licensee and Third Party will immediately stop using the Software, Documentation, and derivatives thereof, and immediately destroy all such copies, remove Software from any of Licensee’s tangible media and from systems on which the Software exists, and stop using, disclosing, copying, or reproducing Software (even as may be permitted by this Agreement). Termination of this Agreement will not affect the right of any end user or consumer to use Licensee Products or Third Party Products provided that such products were purchased prior to the termination of this Agreement. | Dangerous Applications. The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or intended for use in hazardous environments requiring failsafe performance (“Dangerous Applications”). Dangerous Applications include the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, weapons systems, or any environment or system in which the failure of the Software could lead directly or indirectly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. Microchip specifically disclaims (a) any express or implied warranty of fitness for use of the Software in Dangerous Applications; and (b) any and all liability for loss, damages and claims resulting from the use of the Software in Dangerous Applications. | Warranties and Disclaimers.

MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR APPLICATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION. MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET REQUIREMENTS OF LICENSEE OR THIRD PARTY, BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO CORRECT ANY DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE. LICENSEE AND THIRD PARTY ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. | Limited Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL MICROCHIP OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE OR OBLIGATED UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, CONTRIBUTION, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR EXPENSES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, TECHNOLOGY, SERVICES, OR ANY CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DEFENSE THEREOF), OR OTHER SIMILAR COSTS. The aggregate and cumulative liability of Microchip and its licensors for damages hereunder will in no event exceed $1000 or the amount Licensee paid Microchip for the Software and Documentation, whichever is greater. Licensee acknowledges that the foregoing limitations are reasonable and an essential part of this Agreement. | General. (a) Governing Law, Venue and Waiver of Trial by Jury. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA AND THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PROVISIONS. Licensee agrees that any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, Software or Documentation shall be brought in the courts of State of Arizona. The parties agree to waive their rights to a jury trial in actions relating to this Agreement. (b) Attorneys’ Fees.

(c) Entire Agreement. This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It shall not be modified except by a written agreement signed by an authorized representative of Microchip. (d) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. (e) Waiver. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. (f) Export Regulation. Licensee agrees to comply with all export laws and restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce or other United States or foreign agency or authority. (g) Survival. The indemnities, obligations of confidentiality, and limitations on liability described herein, and any right of action for breach of this Agreement prior to termination shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

    "content": "# MPLAB® Harmony 3 Content Manager MPLAB® Harmony 3 is an extension of the MPLAB® ecosystem for creating embedded firmware solutions for Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC microcontroller and microprocessor devices. Refer to the following links for more information. - [Microchip 32-bit MCUs](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/32-bit) - [Microchip 32-bit MPUs](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/32-bit-mpus) - [Microchip MPLAB® X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide) - [Microchip MPLAB® Harmony](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-harmony) - [Microchip MPLAB® Harmony Pages](https://microchip-mplab-harmony.github.io/) This repository contains the implementation of the MPLAB® Harmony 3 Content Manager tool (MHCM). The MHCM is an easy to use development tool with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that simplifies the manipulation of MPLAB® Harmony Content. The MHCM is available as a plugin that directly integrates with the MPLAB® X IDE or as a separate Java executable for standalone use with other development environments. The MHCM includes a downloader tool that reads an online catalog of MPLAB Harmony 3 library packages so that the developers can select and download the libraries in which they are interested. It includes also an Application Browser allowing to copy selected application(s) to any location on your machine. - [Getting started with Content Manager](/contentmanager/doc/readme.html) - [Release Notes](/contentmanager/release_notes.html) ## Setup to launch Content Manager as Standalone This repository can be downloaded and the harmony-content-manager.jar can be executed as standalone. For this, the following setup is requried. - Based on your operating system and Processor Architecture, download JRE 8 with FX support from the given link (https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?&version=java-8-lts&package=jre-fx) - Extract the compressed jre to any location in your system and set the \"PATH\" variable to \"/bin\" - Go to the place where harmony-content-manager.jar is present in Command Line Interface and execute command \"java -jar harmony-content-manager.jar\" ## Content Summary | File/Folder | Description |--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------| *.jar | Java libraries. | harmony-content-manager.jar | Main Java executable (run: java -jar harmony-content-manager.jar) | runme.bat | Windows shell script to run standalone MHCM GUI. | runme.sh | non-Windows shell script to run standalone MHCM GUI. | ## Open source Libraries Content manager uses following open sources libraries: | Library Name | Version | License |-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| [jsch-0.1.54.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.jcraft/jsch/0.1.54) | 0.1.54 | Revised BSD http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/LICENSE.txt | [jsoup-1.10.2.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jsoup/jsoup/1.10.2) | 1.10.2 | MIT License http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php | [org.eclipse.jgit-4.11.0.201803080745-r.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jgit/org.eclipse.jgit/4.11.0.201803080745-r) | 4.11.0.201803080745-r | Eclipse Distribution License (New BSD License) | [simple-xml-2.7.1.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.simpleframework/simple-xml/2.7.1) | 2.7.1 | The Apache Software License, Version 2.0 [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) | [slf4j-api-1.7.25.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-api/1.7.2) | 1.7.25 | MIT License http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php | [slf4j-simple-1.7.25.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-simple/1.7.25) | 1.7.25 | MIT License http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php | [snakeyaml-1.26.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.yaml/snakeyaml/1.26) | 1.26.0 | The Apache Software License, Version 2.0 [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) | [jfoenix-8.0.10.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.jfoenix/jfoenix/8.0.10) | 8.0.10 | The Apache Software License, Version 2.0 [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) | ____ [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Harmony%20license-orange.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/blob/master/mplab_harmony_license.md) [![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/releases/latest) [![Latest release date](https://img.shields.io/github/release-date/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/releases/latest) [![Commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/y/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/graphs/commit-activity) [![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors-anon/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager.svg)]() ____ [![Follow us on Youtube](https://img.shields.io/badge/Youtube-Follow%20us%20on%20Youtube-red.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/user/MicrochipTechnology) [![Follow us on LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Follow%20us%20on%20LinkedIn-blue.svg)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microchip-technology) [![Follow us on Facebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Facebook-Follow%20us%20on%20Facebook-blue.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/microchiptechnology/) [![Follow us on Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/MicrochipTech.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/MicrochipTech) [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager.svg?style=social)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/github/watchers/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager.svg?style=social)]() ",
